What students do on a daily basis throughout their academic year has an impact on their grades. 
Their daily activities include the time they are studying,  spending time with friends, the apps they are using, the time they spend using their phones, texts, calls, etc. 
Their mental condition also plays a significant role in their grades. 
In this exercise, I have worked with some of these above-mentioned data,  collected from students for ten weeks to find their relationships among themselves, and tried to predict their grades based on those data. 
The finding confirms that there are some correlations between the data. 
This report discusses the algorithm used, findings, limitations, and how to make the result more accurate.
